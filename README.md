## Overview

**Project Title**: Mathematical Functions Demonstrator

**Project Description**: This project is a command-line application that demonstrates various mathematical functions, including factorial, Fibonacci, average calculation, prime checking, GCD, LCM, power calculation, and sum of natural numbers.

**Project Goals**: The goal of this project is to provide a user-friendly interface for performing common mathematical calculations and to demonstrate the use of Rust programming concepts such as variables, loops, functions, vectors, and pattern matching.

## Instructions for Build and Use

Steps to build and/or run the software:

1. Ensure you have Rust installed on your system. If not, download and install it from rust-lang.org.
2. Clone the project repository to your local machine.
3. Navigate to the project directory.
4. Compile the project using `rustc main.rs`.
5. Run the compiled executable using `./main`.

Instructions for using the software:
