02/24 | IM | Decided on the project (Fib number gen and other math functions in Rust), Hello World, Understanding the compiler. | 1hr
02/24 | IM | Made a basic factorial Program to demonstrate recursion and basic language Understanding. (Copilot OFF)| 1 hr
02/25 | IM | Learned more about Memory management and how variable sharing and ownership works. | 2 hr 
03/06 | IM | Implimended Fibinacci, improved modularity. Troubleshooted array variables. | 2hrs. 
03/07 | IM | Fixed Fibinacci(I think) Tried to figure out what other math functions I could impliment. I think I figured it out? | 1hrs 
03/08 | IM | Replaced the info function with a basic menu option. Implimented Most of the math functions correctly (I think). Average, LCM, GCM, Power, Natural Numbers. I gave up on my goal of not using any AI. Project compiles and runs mostly correctly. | 3 Hrs 

03/04 | worked on making some dialogue for the team project. | 1hr
03/07 | Made more Dialogue, made a standard JSON map to hold dialogue for each character. | 2hr
